# Configuration file to perform data transformation between two data formats.
# For each operation, first list tells the source or sources, second list target(s)
# and third list defines special operations. There can be multiple special operations performed in list order.
#
# Structure of each operation:
# name for the operation:
# - source class: source paramater  OR - source class (used to copy entities or to create parameters based on entities in which case target entities will get a parameter from 'value')
# - target class: target parameter  OR - target class (used to copy entities)
# - - order: [optional list of lists for dimension positions]:
#       separate list for each dimension in the target - each target dimension can pick dimension names from multiple source dimensions.
#       0 is for the source entity name and indexes 1, 2, etc. are for the source dimension entity names.
#       target name will be based on the first inner list. target dimension names will follow (if multi-dimensional).
#   - rename:
#       source parameter value: target parameter value
#   - algebra: programmatically interpreted algebraic formula between two or more source parameters
#   - [multiply, divide, add or subtract]:
#       with: float
